# Honest Greens Project

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Objective

Right now, in Honest Greens we have a big problem. Our customers are getting extreme, and we are facing a confrontation between the Pollo Piri Piri lovers and the Pollo con Hierbas lovers. These two groups of customers can’t hear anything about the other Pollo otherwise they get crazy. So Honest Greens made a big effort to identify a rule to classify our customer database between these groups. The study reveals that customers with a
“H” or a “B” on their names are always Pollo con Hierbas lovers. Knowing this we need to develop a new application to classify our customers database before sending them any newsletter.

The goal of this test is to assess your ability to use the Vue.js framework to create an application that classifies a set of user data. The task is to build a small application where users can view a list of users with basic information and have the ability to classify them based on different criteria (e.g., by name, age, profile, etc.).
